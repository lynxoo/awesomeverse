👋 Welcome to Awesomeverse — my personal developer notebook. 🪐 It’s a small universe of useful and inspiring things: libraries, tools, snippets, and resources I actually use or found worth saving for later. Everything here is curated by me and organized to speed up everyday work — no fluff.

What you’ll find:
- 🧰 Tools and libraries I really use
- ✂️ Snippets, cheatsheets, and copy‑paste ready bits
- 🐞 Gotchas and debugging notes
- 🔖 Hand‑picked resources that deserve your time
- 🗂️ Tidy, topic‑based sections that evolve over time

Start exploring:
- 🦫 [Go](go/)
- 🐍 [Python](python/)
- 🐧 [Linux](linux/)
- ⚙️ [DevOps](devops/)
- 📚 [Resources](resources/)

🔍 Tip: use the search in the top bar to jump to topics, commands, and config snippets.

🚀 Built by a developer, for developers — it grows with my projects and real‑world experience.
